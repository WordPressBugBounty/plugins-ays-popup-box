Check whether the **Deactivate PHP cache** is ticked from the settings of the cache plugin or not.
If yes, then please **deactivate it.**

No matter whether you are a guest or a logged-in user. The code works in the same way in both cases.

The same is about the mobile version.
You can disable the cache-generating process by deactivating the option from the cache plugin (if it has one).
After clearing the caches, try to check the case with either the **Incognito mode** or **another browser/device.**
